1. Linear Regression :

Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. 

y = a_0 + a_1 * x      ## Linear Equation

The motive of the linear regression algorithm is to find the best values for a_0 and a_1.

cost function :

The cost function helps us to figure out the best possible values for a_0 and a_1 which would provide the best fit line for the data points.

Since we want the best values for a_0 and a_1, we convert this search problem into a minimization problem where we would like to minimize the error between the predicted value and the actual value.
